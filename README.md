# The general idea
Fabwelt Token is a revolutionary concept which brings the world of blockchain, NFTs and future gaming together. Gaming is a big growing industry in this period. It is expected to grow with diverse opportunities for user wanting it. Blockchain industry provides a breathtaking platform for all the gamers which is fruitful to many of them in terms of utilities, incentives, and rewards. 
With todays and the future technology, Fabwelt introduces NFT integration to gameplay as an utility. Imagine a game world that can be modified and changed by its players as they see fit for their game strategy to come out as a winner. Fabwelt will provide just that by using the NFT technology giving a player that owns a unique, rare NFT as an incentive for all kind of games rules and setting during the game. Seeking these rare NFTs will become part of the whole game strategy.
To take gameplay to a broader level for non in-game players and real life sports matches Fabwelt also introduces fantasy gaming as the utility for FWLT token. It eliminates the limitation of fantasy gaming admirers by bringing all of them together at one place. Currently, Fantasy sports is limited to offline or online applications, which can be sometimes boring and less encouraging. The gaming idea motivates all the fantasy players by rewarding the winners and allowing them to participate in designing their own game rules. Freedom is immense and opportunities are never ending. An ecosystem which covers almost all the sports fantasy existing, giving the players a chance to interact with each other over the gaming portals and rooms. Fabwelt makes these gaming enjoyable as it is not only fun to perform but also it would be life changing for many users in many ways. 

Fabwelt will produce a wide range of utility for its main token FWLT:

•	NFTs as in-game utility

•	Play to Earn

•	Fantasy game integration

•	Staking

•	NFT market

•	Giving upcoming artist a unique platform concept
 
# NFT as in-game utility
Fabwelt brings the NFT world and gaming together on the Polygon (previously known as Matic) Network. We do this by creating and integrating existing games on the blockchain where an NFT represents a game settings or game rule. An NFT has a specific setting and or rule that the owner can use in the games while they are playing it. Using these NFTs can give a player very specific but limited advantage over other players in-game match. For example, these advantages in a 3d shooter could be:

•	Infinite ammo for 5 minutes

•	Changing the level that’s being played from daylight to night

•	Freeze all opponents for 5 seconds

•	Change an overall rule like all payers standing still longer than 10 seconds loose

•	Give a player extra health or boost for an amount of time
 
These are just small examples of what a NFT could represent in a game. Fabwelt provides hundreds of different types of NFTs to use in-game with each with its own specific rule or setting. The NFTs and what they can do should be wisely chosen by the player as part of their game strategy based upon their opponents, level, tournament, etc.
Fabwelt will provide an NFT market for this purpose where players can search for one or more specific in-game NFT. The market will provide all details about what a NFT can do in the game. Players buy’s the NFTs they want to use from the market to use in a upcoming game match. Buying these NFTs could be well worth for using them in tournaments where prizemoney can be won. Tournaments will be periodically organized by Fabwelt but can be also organized by anyone in the world using the Fabwelt ecosystem. The NFTs can be bought by the Fabwelt main token FWLT and stored in a Polygon wallet for indefinitely. They can be used anytime when a player plays a game and connect its wallet with the NFTs. Fabwelt will also introduce a way to earn unique, one of kind NFT in-game utility by staking the Fabwelt main token FWLT. These staking rewards in the form of a NFT are random NFTs.
Fabwelt will introduce new games during its future or seek collaboration with existing game producers and games already on the market. For each type of game Fabwelt will introduce their own NFT sets on the NFT market and NFT rewards in case of staking. The NFT section will also be used for a traditional purpose like in-game art. Fabwelt will sign up upcoming artists for this. These NFT will represent achieved in-game accomplishments and unique rare items found in-game. These NFTs and the NFTs earned by staking can also be sold on the Fabwelt NFT market. 

#Fantasy game integration
This type of game changing idea was incubated with the experience of participating in private and public platform conducting fantasy gaming. Over the years, it was noticed that it can be much more entertaining with satisfactory yields in the way of rewards. Currently fantasy league is limited to few users and almost absolutely no contact among fantasy players around the world, which makes it sometimes boring and users losing interest in participation. Fabwelt will bring the players together with live chats where players can joke, discuss, and troll each other. It will create a very healthy ecosystem which can eliminate many factors in one’s life such as stress, lack of information in sports, financial loses and many more to explore. Players can create online rooms while participate as anonymous players or even a group of friends, family and colleagues joining for enhancing fun and pleasure. Rewards will be distributed to each room winner in the form of tokens or NFTs. Daily rewards will be distributed depending on the type of sport and jackpots for the league winners. It gives Fabwelt the chance to provide users their freedom in all forms of deciding the rules and regulations. Also, many factors which even Fabwelt cannot think of.

League game – Fantasy gaming (Football example)
22 football players on field. If a gamer wants to play, he can make a private room of 11 maximum users. Each gamer can select 2 random football players. These rooms will become part of the blockchain with a smart contract.
Playing example:
For a football game, teams (11players * 2 teams = 22 players) are announced 60 minutes before the game starts. Let us imagine, in a game room there could be a maximum of 6 users, AKA fantasy players:  A, B, C, D, E and F. For round 1, A goes first and selects a player, then B chooses until F. After the first round, 6 football players (out of 22) are chosen, and no fantasy player can choose the same football player. In round 2, DEFABC this would be the sequence of choosing players, so D gets to choose first. The sequence for the second round can also be customized. Again 6 football players are chosen. In this way the room selects players and is ready for the game. If a fantasy player or user is unavailable for a game, he/she can opt for auto-selection, in which the game chooses random football players. The winner can choose the rewards in FWLT tokens or a sport NFT exclusively designed for the league. Entering the rooms require a small amount of FWLT tokens.
All aspects are controlled by the smart contract for a specific room. This way rules, randomizing, choices, entering fee and rewards are secured and authenticated.
Fabwelt will extend these fantasy game rooms not only to real life games such as football, cricket, etc. but also to all tournaments that will be hosted by Fabwelt or hosted by others using the Fabwelt in-game NFT system.

# Staking & Rewards 
Fabwelt takes care of the users by incentivizing them in an optimized way, which cannot be compared to any traditional bank or financial institution. It is created to benefit the token holders with maximum possible gains. Fabwelt is just nothing without them. To provide the incentives to our trusted holders we create a staking mechanism that will provide the users’ gifts or rewards in the form of FWLT tokens. Imagine, a currency in your wallet increasing in numbers just with time, only by providing Fabwelt your tokens in the form of staking. Holders are still the owners of the tokens while Fabwelt uses them to let them perform in the background. Also, with the developing community, the power and value of the FWLT token increases in the future. 

There are two benefits of staking: 

· FWLT tokens as rewards 

· Improved value of individual FWLT token 

Such a model with clear transparency makes it justifiable for the users to build a long-term relationship with FABWELT which is the primary fuel for it to grow and keep developing products.
